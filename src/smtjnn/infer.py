"""Inference protocols (v2, post-audit).

Lane-stream evaluation: the test set is split into B independent lanes,
each a true sequential stream of L = N/B images processed one at a time.
Device state persists along a lane exactly as it would on B parallel
chips. For streaming sources, `warmup` unscored images (drawn from the
training set) precede each lane so that scored images are in steady
state — this removes the warm-start artifact where early images see a
freshly equilibrated device. Batch shape is constant (B) at every step,
so no mid-stream state re-initialization can occur.

For settle-mode (streaming=False) sources, `source.new_input()` is called
before each image, triggering the physical settle interval.
